# Data Analysis
  
 ![alt text](analyze.png "Data")
  
   For this assignment, my goal was to present the data from the Airbnb spreadsheet using different 
   plots to help visualize the information and statistics. I used a scatterplot, pie chart, bar graph, 
   and box plot. 
   
 ![alt text](locations.png "Scatterplot")
   
   When creating the scatterplot, I used latitude and longitude to plot where each of the listings in 
   Rockaway Beach are. I noticed that the majority of the listings were located closer to the beach 
   in the south and there were 3 outliers further north. It makes sense that the majority of the houses 
   are closer to the south because this is closer to the public transportation which I learned more 
   about in HC2 and HC3. More specifically, these houses are located closer to the Q22, Q35 local bus, 
   and the Q53 SBS. Roughly 24.22% of residents in Rockaway Beach use public transit in their daily commute. 
   
  ![alt text](typeofrental.png "Pie Chart")
   
   When creating the pie chart, I was surprised to see that 75% of rentals were entire homes while 25% 
   were private rooms. This was shocking to me because Rockaway Beach has about 9,492 housing units 
   with 89.21% being occupied and 10.79% being vacant. Of the occupied housing units, 53.2% were 
   occupied by owners and 46.8% were occupied by renters. Of the vacant housing units, 27.83% were 
   for rent and 0.88% were for sale. I thought the pie chart would be more evenly split.

   When examining the boxplot of the rental prices in Rockaway Beach, one can notice 3 outliers which would 
   skew the mean price. For this reason, I think the median would be a better representation for the 
   center of the data. 
   
  ![alt text](average_price.png "Bar Graph")
   
   When examining the bar graph of all Queens, it is apparent that Rockaway Beach listings are generally 
   only a little more expensive than listings in other areas. However, because I believe the median is 
   a better indication of the center and the median is slightly lower than the mean due to the 3 outliers, 
   I would say the average price in Rockaway Beach (discounting the outliers) is very close to the average 
   price of Queens as a whole.
